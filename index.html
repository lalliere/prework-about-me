      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello everyone! My name is Emily, I am an Operations Manager for the Career and Professional Success Team at the University of New Hampshire, and I moved to Portsmouth this year with my boyfriend and our pet cat, Wayne. I'm really excited to take the UNH Coding Bootcamp course and learn the absolute TON of new information that I expect to learn!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Norwich, CT</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to travel and explore new places! I also like to listen to music, do puzzles, and volunteer at the NHSPCA too.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>A great job would be one where I can problem-solve on a regular basis and be highly organized. My <i>dream</i> job would allow for all of that while still satisfying my desire to travel and work from any location in the world!</p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Web development is all about organization and creative problem solving. It has the freedom to be virtual yet the need for good customer service. I love working with people and teams, but I also like working with computers and understanding technology. I think Web Development will lead me to encounter some exciting new challenges in my life, and I can't wait!</p>
